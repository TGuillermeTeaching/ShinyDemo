# Shiny

This quick tutorial will cover three main parts:

 * The very basics: where we're going to look at the structure of a shiny app.
 * Deploying your app: A quick example on how to make your app public.
 * How to do cool stuff: A list of tips on how to go further and use shiny for your actual project.

### What you need before the tutorial?

Through this tutorial I'll assume you have some basic `R` and computer skills. What I mean by that is that you have a basic understanding of the following (i.e. you answer yes to the following questions):

 * You have used a function in `R`.
 * You have used a `"list"` object in `R`.
 * You have used the `<-` attribution function in `R`.
 * You have installed and loaded packages in `R`.
 * You have changed your directory in `R`.
 * You have executed a script in `R`.

The following points are useful but not essential:

 * You have created a function in `R`.
 * You have used a shell script in a terminal.

### Some useful scripts

If you're using shell, you can download these scripts (right click + save as) for saving time. Don't worry if you're not using shell or you don't like saving time, we'll go through them manually below.
